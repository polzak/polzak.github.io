## My process

### Built with

- Normal HTML and CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Some elements such as a button will have their own default border width or paddings; you need to reset them to be more precise with the original design.  
- The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions. (MDN)

### Useful resources
