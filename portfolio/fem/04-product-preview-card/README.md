## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There is an extra gap just below an image: an image sits on baseline by default, it makes the extra gap.
You can make its vertical-align middle or bottom (instead of baseline), or make its display block.

```css
img {
  vertical-align: bottom;  /* display: block; */
}
```
