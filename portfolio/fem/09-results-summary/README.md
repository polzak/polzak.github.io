## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

- At first, the upper results box's box-shadow was overlapped by the lower summary box. When I applied `position: relative;` to the upper box, the box-shadow was not overlapped any more and appeared over the lower box. I think the `position: relative;` made another context for the upper box and the box shadow was able to be displayed. `z-index` also could work on a box once you applied `position: relative` to it.

- how to read a JSON file in JavaScript with import statement:

```html
<html lang="en">
    // ...
    <body>
        <script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
```js
import data from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' };
console.log(data);
```

Note: if we run this locally â€“ then we would get the CORS error. (Instead, use local server to open the index.html file.)

- It's good to avoid setting fixed `padding-left` or `padding-right` values in an element that belongs to a box: you will not be able to set your box width using percentage values due to their fixed width.
