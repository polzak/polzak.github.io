### What I learned

- At first, the upper results box's box-shadow was overlapped by the lower summary box. When I applied `position: relative;` to the upper box, the box-shadow was not overlapped any more and appeared over the lower box. I think the `position: relative;` made another context for the upper box and the box shadow was able to be displayed. `z-index` also could work on a box once you applied `position: relative` to it.
